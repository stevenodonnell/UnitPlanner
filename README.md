# UnitPlanner
Unit planner for organizing my semester lessons


This is a file to:
- organize lessons (named units right now). You can move lessons around up and down.
- create subunits (should be called daily lessons)
- calculate days used in a semester with these lessons. Days of the semester need to be hard coded each semester.
